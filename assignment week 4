Q:  What is a Storageclass? 
A: After going through couple of articles and blog posts on Kubernetes storage class,
following is my understanding on Storage class 
PVs 
Any volume that is persists after the Pod is not active (crashed / Deleted / not in use ) can be termed as persistent Volume.
SSDs/NVMe Disk / NAS  etc on cloud or onPrem physical devices can be a persistent volume. 
PVs are abstraction for physical volume and together with PVC they provide PODs the required data that can be stored after a Pod is inactive. This is specially useful when multiple pods are orchestrated in pipeline and the data needs to be shared 

PVCs 
A K8 Pod  consume persistent volume(PV)  by issuing a claim – Persistent Volume Claim. , i.e. PVC object lets pod use storage from any of the specified persistent Volume.

StorageClass
Storage Class is K8 object which provide a way to create PV/PVC pair which will be used by a POD when a pod is created
You don’t have to create PV separately before claming it. Storage class help to define information where POD can utilize volumes. 

We first, define a Storageclass, where we carve out specification of type of storage we require for a POD. We define Name of  Storageclass,  provisioner, reclaimPolicy, volumeBindingMode. 
Then a PVC yaml file is created with storageclass to claim a dedicated storage for application POD. 




"hostname storage class" mean?
In our class Lab we have specified – hostpath in our PVC yaml file which, basically, mounts a directory from a host file system on which Node is present. 
This is easiest way to have a persistent volume, although it have some security concerns. 
Hostname Storageclass will define a file or directory from the underlying host node’s filesystem.

Q: 	Explain the differences between this week's kubernetes "deployment" 
(as described in the YAML file) from last week's. Be specific.
A: 	One of the major change from week 3 K8 deployment is the usage of Persistent Storage  Volume. 
	In last weeks yaml  file we used an empty directory 
i.e. 
volumes: 
- name: jenkins-home 
   emptyDir: { }

In this weeks Deployment yaml file, we have used  PV/PVC + StorageClass  concept to retain the data from Jenkins.
Specifically -  we have used a PVC object which is defined in “Jenkins-pvc.yaml” and in that file we have used a “Hostpath”  storage class which tell PODs to use host Node’s  storage ( in our case its Docker Desktop )  
i.e 
volumes:
    - name: jenkins-data
      persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: jenkins-pv-claim
------ 
Also we have used Monitoring in the Service yaml 
Prometheus – allows for Scraping on a particular port define to collect all the metrics 

Service.yaml 
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: jenkins-service
  annotations:
      prometheus.io/scrape: 'true'
      prometheus.io/path:   /
      prometheus.io/port:   '8080'
